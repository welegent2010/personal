# Academic CV

You can preview the CV as a [PDF](https://welegent2010.github.io/personal/share/cv-gboeing.pdf).

This repo contains [Wang Xiaodong](https://welegent2010.github.io/personal/)'s **LaTeX academic CV**, permissively licensed for others to adapt.

The CV content and formatting emphasize clear information presentation and typography. The CV's TeX file is *automatically compiled* to PDF and published whenever a commit is pushed to the main branch, via this [workflow](https://github.com/welegent2010/personal/blob/main/.github/workflows/build_publish.yml). This keeps the publicly distributed PDF up-to-date while avoiding commit history pollution from frequent changes to a binary file.
